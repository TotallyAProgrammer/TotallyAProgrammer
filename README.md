### Howdy there partner! ðŸ‘‹

GitHub says this thing is âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨, so it must be something important!

I'm Zane Reick, a jack of all trades, master of some.
I have a "special touch" when it comes to programming, systems management, and network management (Big, smol, enterprise, and home!).
I have spent countless hours learning the depths of each. I can manage anything given a few hours with it.
I've built my own scalable, high capacity, enterprise level network that powers all of the things I host.
Along with that I have experience with Docker, Kubernetes, ESXI, and Xen. Though I am constantly experimenting and growing my knowledge on everything.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about networking! I'd love to help!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Email me! I'll try and respond, I promise.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him/They/Them (Usually prefer They/Them)
